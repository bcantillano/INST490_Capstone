                <p><b>Project Summary: F Community Analytics (Sociotechnical Networks)</b></p>
                <p>
                    This project will develop an analysis of a community based on sampling from real communities. 
                    The data it collects and reports on will show a range of kinds of entities from restaurants to doctor’s 
                    offices to hospitals. It will also have the ability to show connections between entities such as doctor’s 
                    offices that use a common lab and doctors that are parts of various practices and also have hospital 
                    relationships. This information will be in the form of social networks as well as technical relationships. 
                    The analytics need to be visualized using a social graph structure in a web interface. The technology 
                    chosen should be compatible with Python and ideally with a relational database structure, although integration 
                    tools can be used to address these issues.</p>
